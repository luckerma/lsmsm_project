This report conducts an agent-based transport simulation in France. The study area is Calvados, a department in the Normandy region. The simulation is based on the production-attraction-distribution model. The data sources include the INSEE Census [@inseeCensus], IGN [@ign], INSEE Aggregated [@inseeAggregated], URSSAF [@urssaf] and Geofabrik [@geofabrik]. Before the simulation, which consists of disaggregation and routing, a territorial analysis is carried out and the necessary trips are generated.
